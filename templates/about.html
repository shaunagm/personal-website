                    <p>I'm a programmer and a writer, a researcher and a community manager, and a lot of other
                    things besides. I tend to work at the intersection of people and technology and I have a soft
                    spot in my heart for anything open: open science, open government, open source software.</p>


                    <p>I run a technical consulting business, <a href="http://www.galaxyriseconsulting.com">Galaxy Rise Consulting</a>,
                    where I work with individuals and organizations to address their technical needs. While I am
                    theoretically open to all sorts of projects, I am currently focused on projects related to
                    digital governance and to progressive technology.</p>

                    <p>I serve on the Board of Directors of <a href="https://techinquiry.org/">Tech Inquiry</a>,
                    a non-profit run by tech workers combatting problems and abuses in the tech industry. I am part
                    of the core group that leads <a href="https://metagov.org/">Metagov</a>. I am also the corresponding
                    secretary for the <a href="http://ward4democratsdc.org/">Ward 4 Democratic Party</a>.</p>

                    <p>Please feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KBE6hOiBADkqgFz5poBBWZhMvz4X1XmJG5-y84a_h0c/viewform">get in touch</a>.</p>
