                    <p>I'm a programmer and a writer, a researcher and a community manager, and a lot of other
                    things besides.  I tend to work at the intersection of people and technology and I have a soft
                    spot in my heart for anything open: open science, open government, open source software.</p>

                    <p>I currently run a technology consulting business, <a href="http://www.galaxyriseconsulting.com">Galaxy Rise Consulting</a>.
                    I work primarily with individuals and small organizations to address their technical needs,
                    whether that means building websites and plugins, analyzing datasets, or documenting messy code.</p>
            
                    <p>I serve on the Board of Directors of <a href="https://techinquiry.org/">Tech Inquiry</a>,
                        a non-profit run by tech workers combatting problems and abuses in the tech
                        industry.  I also co-organize the DC chapter of the <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">
                        Tech Workers Coalition</a>.</p>
            
                    <p>I'm always interested in potential collaborations, so if you have an idea or
                        an opportunity, please  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KBE6hOiBADkqgFz5poBBWZhMvz4X1XmJG5-y84a_h0c/viewform">get in touch</a>.</p>
