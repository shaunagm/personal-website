                    <p>I'm a programmer and a writer, a researcher and a community manager, and a lot of other
                    things besides. I tend to work at the intersection of people and technology and I have a soft
                    spot in my heart for anything open: open science, open government, open source software.</p>


                    <p>In the past I've run a technical consulting business, <a href="http://www.galaxyriseconsulting.com">Galaxy Rise Consulting</a>,
                        where I work with individuals and organizations to address their technical needs. That business
                        is currently on pause while I focus on <a href="https://www.glizzan.com/">Glizzan</a>, 
                        an organization dedicated to helping communities govern themselves better. 
                        Glizzan's main product at the moment is Concord, a Python library which enables community self-governance,
                        and <a href="https://www.kybern.org/">Kybern</a>, a website which demonstrates this functionality.</p>
                    
                        <p>I serve on the Board of Directors of <a href="https://techinquiry.org/">Tech Inquiry</a>,
                        a non-profit run by tech workers combatting problems and abuses in the tech
                        industry.  I also co-organize the DC chapter of the <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">
                        Tech Workers Coalition</a>.</p>
            
                    <p>Please feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KBE6hOiBADkqgFz5poBBWZhMvz4X1XmJG5-y84a_h0c/viewform">get in touch</a>.</p>
