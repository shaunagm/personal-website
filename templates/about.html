                    <p>I'm a programmer and a writer, a researcher and a community manager, and a lot of other
                    things besides. I tend to work at the intersection of people and technology and I have a soft
                    spot in my heart for anything open: open science, open government, open source software.</p>

                    <p>I run a technical consulting business, <a href="http://www.galaxyriseconsulting.com">Galaxy Rise Consulting</a>.
                    While I am open to all sorts of clients, I am currently focused on governance.  My main projects right now are 
                    <a href="https://governingopen.com/">Governing Open</a>, an effort to collect and disseminate best practices in 
                    open source governance, and <a href="https://www.parsonsproject.org/">the Parsons Project</a>, which supports 
                    progressive tech and data professionals.</p>

                    <p>I currently serve as an advisor to <a href="https://techinquiry.org/">Tech Inquiry</a> and 
                    <a href="https://about.iftas.org/">IFTAS</a> (Independent Federated Trust and Safety).</p>

                    <p>Please feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KBE6hOiBADkqgFz5poBBWZhMvz4X1XmJG5-y84a_h0c/viewform">get in touch</a>.</p>
