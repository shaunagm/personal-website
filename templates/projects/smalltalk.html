              <p>Smalltalk is an Android app that helps you keep track of things you
                want to talk about with friends, family, colleagues, and even strangers.
                It was my first Java project and my first mobile app, and I learned quite
                a bit from making it.  You can download it from
                <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smalltalkapp.android.smalltalk&hl=en">the Google Play
                store</a>.</p>
